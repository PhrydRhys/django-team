The summary should contain the following items:

- list of issues that you attempted/considered with a brief comment stating if you decided to work on it or not and how successful the work was

- list of pull requests with a mention of its current status (accepted, rejected, still waiting, making changes, ...) and a list of group members who worked on that pull request

|#|Pull Request #|Status|Group Members|
|-|--------------|------|-------------|

- for each group member individually: a list of commits to the fork repository in the class organization (some of you have lots of them in different branches and finding them turned out to be challenging)
