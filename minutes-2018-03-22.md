Team members: Jessica Fushada, Kelly Hogan, Rohit Motwani, Kenneth Yang (Shiyang Wang absent)  

Things we did:  
- Decide on a new alternative meeting time: Thursday 5-7 will no longer work. We're having trouble scheduling, but we tentatively decided on Friday 3:30-5:30. Need Shiyang's confirmation.
- We might have to end up rescheduling every time if our primary meeting time doesn't work (which hopefully will never happen).
- Our primary meeting time: Wednesday 2-4 pm. 
- We all have python 3. (Rohit has multiple versions which are being a bit troublesome but he will resolve it)
- We all installed development environments. (Need to check virtual environments)
- Kenneth and Jessica on Windows, Kelly and Shiyang on Mac, Rohit on Windows and Linux if he gets it working.
- Signed up for mailing lists (users and developers)
  - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-users
  - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-developers
- After looking at the users mailing lists, we decided to unsubscribe because it seemed more like a stackexchange/customer support and not too helpful.
- Signed up for the IRC chat on freenode:
  - https://webchat.freenode.net/ on #django channel
  - We needed authentication to join the #django channel, so the steps required are:
  - first sign in without authentication (just nickname and channel)
  - It will tell you that you're not allowed to log in, so you need to register an IRC nick by this command: /msg NickServ REGISTER password youremail@example.com
  - You will be sent an email to register with a validation command.
  - and when you log back in to freenode, you can authenticate with your username and password.
    - at first glance, it looked like the IRC chat is largely like the users mailing list, which is not promising, but we'll let the conversation continue and judge.
