Team members: Jessica Fushada, Kelly Hogan, Rohit Motwani, Kenneth Yang (Shiyang Wang absent)  

Things we did:  
- Decide on a new alternative meeting time: Thursday 5-7 will no longer work. We're having trouble scheduling, but we tentatively decided on Friday 3:30-5:30. Need Shiyang's confirmation.
- We might have to end up rescheduling every time if our primary meeting time doesn't work (which hopefully will never happen).
- Our primary meeting time: Wednesday 2-4 pm. 
- We all have python 3. (Rohit has multiple versions which are being a bit troublesome but he will resolve it)
- We all installed development environments. (Need to check virtual environments)
- Kenneth and Jessica on Windows, Kelly and Shiyang on Mac, Rohit on Windows and Linux if he gets it working.
- Signed up for mailing lists (users and developers)
  - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-users
  - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-developers
- After looking at the users mailing lists, we decided to unsubscribe because it seemed more like a stackexchange/customer support and not too helpful.
- Signed up for the IRC chat on freenode:
  - https://webchat.freenode.net/ on #django channel
  - We needed authentication to join the #django channel, so the steps required are:
  - first sign in without authentication (just nickname and channel)
  - It will tell you that you're not allowed to log in, so you need to register an IRC nick by this command: /msg NickServ REGISTER password youremail@example.com
  - You will be sent an email to register with a validation command.
  - and when you log back in to freenode, you can authenticate with your username and password.
  - at first glance, it looked like the IRC chat is largely like the users mailing list, which is not promising, but we'll let the conversation continue and judge
  - IRC nicknames: page394 (Jessica), rdm403 (Rohit), kellyh (Kelly)
  - After letting the IRC chat run for a while (about 30 mins), it seems like the activity is mostly people joining and quitting, and a very small amount of conversation
- Looking at tickets
  - Cleanup and optimization tickets look doable
  - Actual bugs do not look as doable. 
  - there are no new unassigned easy pickings as of right now, but the assigned ones look doable for the most part
  - Specific ticket we looked at and discussed: id #29233 - closed easy pickings ticket on optimization/cleanup
  - We need to check how often easy pickings tickets come by. The last easy pickings ticket was opened 5 hours ago, so we should be okay. We need to stay attentive for new tickets. Out of 5 easy pickings tickets, 1 is cleanup/optimization and there seems to be at least 1 easy pickings ticket per day. There are also a few assigned tickets that are not worked on, and we can check how taking others' tickets. 
  - Looking up protocol for assigning bugs: If accepted and there are no flags, there are no patches and we can write one. IF there are patches, they are in the verification stage and we shouldn't do it, but we can help verify. Assigned is a status, not a flag and means that it's a valid issue, not necessarily that someone has taken the issue (?). 
  - Assigned vs Accepted tag, we need to figure that out.
  - There are three easy pickings issues that are assigned but don't have a patch: https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=assigned&has_patch=0&easy=1&desc=1&order=id
  - Specific ticket: https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/28290 - last update 10 months ago.
  - Found out that language bugs exist in Django, so that may be something we can help. We can do French, Hindi, Indonesian, Simplifed Chinese, and Spanish.
  - There are also 8 unreviewed tickets - by replicating the bugs and confirming them. Does this count as a contribution? On further inspection, they don't look easy.
  - Looking at new features to work on
  - Internationalization bugs
  - Maybe to triage, we should send messages to assigned/accepted tickets that haven't been updated in a long time (low chances of replies, though)
  - Sheperding - assigning a member of the community who micro-manages the assignee - in charge of the issue. We could be "sheperds". 
  - Reference to how sheperding issues work: https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct/blob/master/reports.md
 
 - We are considering looking at different projects that might be easier to contribute to, because it seems that the issues are out of our reach.
 - Pokemon Showdown? a pokemon battle simulator. github: https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown
 
 - Conclusion: We're going to monitor django over the weekend, and we might talk to Joanna on Monday or Tuesday on our decision.
