Things To do:
1) what have you achieved since last week (project related)
- downloaded python 3 and django's web dev
- signed up for mailing lists and irc
- looked at tickets (open and closed) and judged them based by doability
- panicked and started looking at alternative projects
- looked through tickets for one that might help guide us through the life cycle of a ticket
- looked at documentation to help us parse the process
2) What did each member do since last week (project related)
- Everyone - downloade python 3, django web dev, signed up for mailing lists and irc chat
- Jessica - kept track of the meeting (wrote up minutes). looked through django's bug tracker with the others and brainstormed alternative projects.
- Rohit - Browsed closed tickets for good ones to go over, browsed open tickets for one's that we might be able to work on as a group
- Kelly - looked into some of the “Easy Pickings” tickets to see if they are doable and created a new directory to organize our meeting notes.
- Shiyang - caught up with our meeting notes, looked through the easy tickets but couldn’t find anything that looked particularly beginner friendly. For alternative projects, I found p5.js as a potential alternative
- Kenneth - Helped triage issues during group meeting & idenitfying how many issues are possibly workable under easy-pickings, Looked at django tickets over the weekend: did not find any easier ones than the ones Rohit picked out, suggested new projects
3) What are you going to accomplish in the next hour
- Look at closed tickets that Rohit picked out and possible open tickets

  - https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/18315
  - https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/22558
  - https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/18380

  - it goes from unreviewed to accepted, categorized, then it gets assigned to a person, gets a patch in a pull request, and it then says that it's closed or the patch need improvement
  - everything is very fast, literally days

- Look at opened tickets and triage
- https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29258
  - Assigned, not closed
  - Opened 2 days ago
  - There is a patch that has been accepted but needs improvement
  - Last modified 25 hours ago
  - The life cycle is very quick
  - The issue is about error messages, the patch is missing tests
  - Then someone did all the tests - on github pull request - last night

- https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29148
  - Opened 5 weeks ago, last modified 11 days ago
  - assigned, has patch that needs imporvement and nothing since then.
  - In general the queryset is pretty bad on django, and the documentation is pretty weak
  - We can add examples to the queryset page on documentation, to help people understand it better
  - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/models/querysets/
  - we should look into how to contribute in documentation
  - Nevermind, it was closed on github 2 hours ago. It just hasn't been updated on the Django bug tracker yet.
  - It got accepted but it hasn't been merged yet
  
- Kelly is keeping the IRC channel open to read through later - might be useful
  - Lordofthekebabs asked a question and it was answered
  - mostly people quitting
  - binarydreams also asked another questions
  - the best part of the IRC chat are the nicknames.
- Problem - the life cycle is too quick, very active (the open tickets are from only a few weeks ago and they close very quicklu)
  - joanna suggested that we should start talking in the maiing lists and making our presence known 
  - we are newbies and maybe need more time than others to work on the easy tickets
- We should look into localization tags
- We should definitely look into alternative projects. - maybe have a safety
  - Shiyang and Kelly are looking into the alternative projects right now
  - a lot don't have enough open issues
  - habitica 
  - p5.js
  - karrot - humanitarian! built on django, python, some javascript frontend - https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend
  - up-for-grabs.net - http://up-for-grabs.net/#/tags/python
  - Motivate
- Still looking at the open and closed tickets - Rohit, Kenneth and Jessica
- The thing is, looking at new projects, we'll have to relearn 

- To do tomorrow: find a new project (or 4). Options
  - look into alternatives tonight
  - We're deciding on a new project tomorrow.
