Things To do:
1) what have you achieved since last week (project related)
- downloaded python 3 and django's web dev
- signed up for mailing lists and irc
- looked at tickets (open and closed) and judged them based by doability
- panicked and started looking at alternative projects
- looked through tickets for one that might help guide us through the life cycle of a ticket
- looked at documentation to help us parse the process
2) What did each member do since last week (project related)
- Everyone - downloade python 3, django web dev, signed up for mailing lists and irc chat
- Jessica - kept track of the meeting (wrote up minutes). looked through django's bug tracker with the others and brainstormed alternative projects.
- Rohit - Browsed closed tickets for good ones to go over, browsed open tickets for one's that we might be able to work on as a group
- Kelly - looked into some of the “Easy Pickings” tickets to see if they are doable and created a new directory to organize our meeting notes.
- Shiyang - caught up with our meeting notes, looked through the easy tickets but couldn’t find anything that looked particularly beginner friendly. For alternative projects, I found p5.js as a potential alternative
- Kenneth - Helped triage issues during group meeting & idenitfying how many issues are possibly workable under easy-pickings, Looked at django tickets over the weekend: did not find any easier ones than the ones Rohit picked out, suggested new projects
3) What are you going to accomplish in the next hour
- Look at closed tickets that Rohit picked out and possible open tickets
