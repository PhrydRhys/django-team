Rohit, Jessica, Kenneth, Kelly (Shiyang participating remotely)

## Goals:
 - Final project decision - We picked Django
 - Triaging (looking for) more issues
 	- confirming known issues
 - Rohit - fix linux installation of django (or re-install)
 - Make ourselves known to the community (developers mailing list)

## Django issues looked at:
- [28581](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/28581) (**Pagination topic docs need a little restructuring**):
  - Assigned to the issue author (he/she claimed his/her own issue), looking at its [pull request](https://github.com/django/django/pull/9052), someone reviewed the changes made, and made suggestions & gave critiques. Unfortunately, no updates since Oct 2017 welp

- [29274](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29274) (**Update the password list used by CommonPasswordValidator to a more recent list**):
  - Looks doable, ~~will try to claim~~ claimed by Jessica!

- [29279](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29279) (**Added renderer argument to BaseModelForm to match BaseForm**):
  - Closed already, but looked doable, gives us confidence of finding more doable issues

- [29261](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29261) (**Clarify the reason for LICENSE.python**):
  - Assigned and has a patch, will try to confirm patch. According to its [pull request](https://github.com/django/django/pull/9825), patch need an additional change, and the user claiming the patch has not added it yet

- [29131](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29131) (**Make the error message for ArrayField more user and translation-friendly**):
  - Accepted, no patch, no one working on it, looks doable, but we're still triaging it. We disagree with comments by core development Tim Grahm about changing arrays to list and starting from 1 instead of 0 to please the general non-cs kiddies, unsure if we want to contribute out opinions on 7 week-old thread

- [28273](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/28273) (**Document how to prevent adding columns with defaults in migrations**):
  - Still reading/triaging, large wall of text in this ticket requires careful parsing

- [28539](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/28539) (**REMOTE_USER auth docs (and middleware logging?) should mention that headers with underscores are stripped when using "runserver" command**):
  - Assigned, still triaging

## Additional Notes:
Regarding Rohit's Python 3 & Django installation: he did it! (hooray)
