Presentation (What Professor Klukowska told us in Tuesday's meeting)
- Describe the entire journey
- including looking for an alternative
- What was it about this project that you picked initially, then spent a week for two looking for alternatives
and then why did you decide to stay with django
- you talked several times that issues were fixed within a few days of reporting, which is great for the project but horrible for newcomers trying to resolve it.
- Describing the whole process. Don't care much about seeing the actual fix and the actual code that you committed . Describe what the issue was, make sure that someone who's not familiar to django knows what the problem is at the high level.
- issues that you had: which password to edit, how to edit, what changed.
