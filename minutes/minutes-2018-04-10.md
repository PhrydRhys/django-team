Team members: Jessica, Kenneth, Shiyang, Rohit, Kelly

#### To do today:

* Look into testing

* Figure out how to make our change

* Look into testing. There are existing tests for the old password list, so we most likely need to update the tests and possibly create new ones. 

#### What was completed:

* Kelly took notes and added a link to our team fork in the README

* Rohit is changing the common passwork list to the new list we found 

* Kenneth updated README with slides and guidelines to contributing to Django

* Jessica and Shiyang looked into testing our project in a test suite

* There is an event in our usual meeting place for tomorrow, so we discussed alternate meeting locations

	* Possible alternates:

		* GCASL
		
		* Lipton
		
		* Bobst

#### [Someone tried to fix the same change as we are attempting](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36185623/django-1-9-common-password-validator-strange-behaviour)

* They ran into problems with stripping the file and adding newlines

* Notepad hides hidden characters, so we can run into problems if we use if during development

* For us, we need to strip the file because the new password list from the ticket that we found has a different format that does not adhere to the old format

Rohit is writting a script to strip the file because there are 20,000 passwords

* We should check if all the old passowrds are in the new password list

* Are the hex values parsed correctly?

	* There are 40 hex values

#### The [new password list](https://gist.github.com/roycewilliams/281ce539915a947a23db17137d91aeb7)

Jessica will gzip the file that Rohit parsed (with a python script, yay!)

* Rohit push our parsed and updated password list

#### TODO for later:

* Kelly and Kenneth - verify if old passwords are in new list

* Jessica - How do we handle the incorrectly parsed hex passwords for our tests?

	* We should ask someone

* Shiyang - how do we run tests

* Rohit - fix his fork and update changes
