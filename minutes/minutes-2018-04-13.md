We're meeting up again because Wednesday's meeting did not last 2 hours (due to trying to find a room; our normal meeting room became unavaible from 12-4pm that day)

On Wedneday evening, Kelly reported that we do not need to write our own tests, and that using the tests that are already provided.

So Kelly & Jessica ran tests with our changed code and got different result. The tests were ran on Rohit's computer and we got the same outputs as Jessica's results 

Kelly:
- OK (skipped=873, expected failures=4)

Jessica & Rohit:
- OK (skipped=946, expected failures=4)
