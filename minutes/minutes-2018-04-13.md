We're meeting up again for about an hour because Wednesday's meeting did not last 2 hours (due to trying to find a room; our normal meeting room became unavaible from 12-4pm that day)

On Wedneday evening, Kelly did some research on her own and reported that we do not need to write our own tests, and that using the tests that are already provided:
When we looked more into the scripting and since the logic of CommonPasswordValidator is in this link: https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/django/blob/master/django/contrib/auth/password_validation.py, it seems that we don't need to write any more tests. The actual test module that uses CommonPasswordValidator is called auth_tests and the file we care about is https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/django/blob/master/tests/auth_tests/test_validators.py. If we only wanted to test the CommonPasswordValidatorTest, we can run ./runtests.py auth_tests.test_validators.CommonPasswordValidatorTest from /tests. I ran this as well as the complete test suite with ./runtests.py and there seem to be no problems.

So Kelly & Jessica ran tests with our changed code and got different result. The tests were ran _*twice*_ on Rohit's computer and we got the same outputs as Jessica's results 

Kelly:
- OK (skipped=873, expected failures=4)

Jessica & Rohit:
- OK (skipped=946, expected failures=4)

While validating password strings:
- Validate "gozilla"
- Validate "a-saved-password"
- One more unknown string

"godzilla" -> common
"a-saved-password" -> uncommon

We think there may be a difference between operating systems, since Kelly's machine is a mac, while Jessica and Rohit's are on windows. (We opted out on using Kenneth's for now because it's on windows and the computer is pretty cripplped, BUT he will get it working by next meeting)
So we will try testing on Shiyang' mac (Kelly & Shiyang worked together) to see if our hypothesis is true or not. Unfortunately, we were unable to test it on her machine due to an error with getting the tests (will be looking more into it next Tuesday)

Also, following Joanna's advice on trying to submit our fix early to receive feedback and for further information and direction for the ticket, we have decided to reach out by submitting our PR and listing the details of our findings and post in the Google Group discussion:
- [PR](https://github.com/django/django/pull/9875)
- [Google Group Discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-developers/oMWLVK5kTpI/discussion) ~(post pending)~ *Response received later that day!*

Goals by/for next meeting:
- Continue testing by
  - Try get testing environment working for Kenneth's & Shiyang's machine
  - Act upon the feedback from the Google Group Discussion
      - "One approach you might try is on every test run, randomly select some lines from the list of common passwords and verify they fail the validator. That way we know it's not just testing a single, fixed, contrived case." (Quote added on 4/14)
  - Act upon any comments & feedback on our PR (None as of 4/14)
- Start working on final presentation, if possible
