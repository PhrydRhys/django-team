We're meeting up again for about an hour because Wednesday's meeting did not last 2 hours (due to trying to find a room; our normal meeting room became unavaible from 12-4pm that day)

On Wedneday evening, Kelly reported that we do not need to write our own tests, and that using the tests that are already provided:
When we looked more into the scripting and since the logic of CommonPasswordValidator is in this link: https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/django/blob/master/django/contrib/auth/password_validation.py, it seems that we don't need to write any more tests. The actual test module that uses CommonPasswordValidator is called auth_tests and the file we care about is https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/django/blob/master/tests/auth_tests/test_validators.py. If we only wanted to test the CommonPasswordValidatorTest, we can run ./runtests.py auth_tests.test_validators.CommonPasswordValidatorTest from /tests. I ran this as well as the complete test suite with ./runtests.py and there seem to be no problems.

So Kelly & Jessica ran tests with our changed code and got different result. The tests were ran _*twice*_ on Rohit's computer and we got the same outputs as Jessica's results 

Kelly:
- OK (skipped=873, expected failures=4)

Jessica & Rohit:
- OK (skipped=946, expected failures=4)

While validating actually password strings
Validate gozilla, validate a-saved-password (which is , and one more unknown file(?) idk why am I writing this
"gozilla" -> common, "a-saved-password" -> uncommon

We think there may be a difference between operating systems, since Kelly's machien is a mac, while Jessica and Rohit's are on windows. (We opted out on using Kenneth's because it's on windows and the computer is pretty cripplped.)
So we will try testing on Shiyang' mac to see if our hypothesis is true or not.

We have decided to reach out by submitting our PR and listing the details of our findings and post in the google group discussion for further information and direction for the ticket:
