Team members: Jessica, Kenneth, Shiyang, Rohit, Kelly

#### To do today: 

* Continue working on goals from our last meeting 

* Rohit, Kelly, Kenneth - Write script to sort passwords in order to correctly compare diffs in old and new password files. 
	* Change old password list to new password list with additions from old password list. 

* Shiyang - how do we run tests

* Rohit - write script to sort passwords 


#### What was completed:

* Received reply back from Django developers: Incorrectly parsed hex passwords are errors and should be removed 

* Shiyang took notes and found resource on how to test (still awaiting completed new password list updated with passwords from old passwords to run actual tests)
	* Included key steps of testing 

* Jessica - created new branch for our ticket and updated master
	* [Updated documentation](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/django/commit/afbe18cd23efe20ca63afd4f0dafeb34fb079c7d) in our branch with "20,000 Most Common Passwords" instead of "1000 Most Common Passwords"

* Rohit: finished writing script and created final updated password list 
	* Double checked by Kenneth and Kelly 
	* Pushed final [updated password list](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/django/commit/6a609490477cabfaf5f83485099ca7a3bc276b8c) with the passwords originally not included from old password list to our branch 


#### [New branch for ticket](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/django/tree/ticket_29274) 

#### Testing: 

[Writing your first patch for Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/contributing/)

* TL;DR Guidelines: 
1. Create a branch for our patch 
2. Run tests specific to our patch (because we are not providing an entirely new feature, we don't have to write our own tests, they are already provided. We will have to update the tests to run for the new updated list rather than the old password list) with ./runtests.py PASSWORD_TESTS
3. Run entire Django test suite with ./runtests.py
4. Preview changes with git diff
5. Commit with message similar to: Fixed #29274 -- Updated old password list with new updated password list (follow [committing guidelines](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/committing-code/#committing-guidelines))
6. Push commit and make a pull request with git push origin ticket_29274

* Optional testing: 
	* Create new user and test new password list 


#### The [final updated password list](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/django/commit/6a609490477cabfaf5f83485099ca7a3bc276b8c)


#### TODO for later:

* TESTING (4/13/18): 
1. Do tests
2. Update existing tests

* Send patch after running tests
