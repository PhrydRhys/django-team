Team members: Jessica, Kenneth, Shiyang, Rohit, Kelly

**Goals**

* Find commits for Kenneth, Shiyang, and Kelly

**Ticket [29122](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29122)**

* Tim Graham reached out to us concerning . He said that since the ticket is tagged as "someday/maybe" for its status, it is "premature to assign the ticket". He suggested that we propose a solution on the [Developer's Mailing List](https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DevelopersMailingList). As a group we have decided to not move forward with this ticket because there is not enough time to propose and then work though a solution. 

**Django's License file**

We googled "projects that use BSD license"...

* Django's license file does not mention that it is a BSD license(even though the contents of the license file are the terms of the BSD license), but the website does, so this is a possible Issue to submit. We are investigating other projects to see if this is standard, or an error on Django's part.

* [react-canvas](https://github.com/Flipboard/react-canvas/blob/master/LICENSE) does not mention the name of the BSD license in it's license file, but the project has the header automatically generated when they chose the BSD license.

* [Lektor](https://github.com/lektor/lektor/blob/master/LICENSE) does not even mention the name of the BSD license, which seems to be the case with the majority of the projects we looked at.

* [Pure](https://github.com/pure-css/pure/blob/master/LICENSE.md) mentions the name of the BSD license in the license file, but it is only in the form of a header.

So, we have decided to not raise an issue

## We are still desperate for new issues, which has been the case for the past few weeks... help

**Pull request [9825](https://github.com/django/django/pull/9825)**

* The last comment on this pull request was 25 days ago and it is not merged yet. 

* Shiyang commented on the pull request asking if there are any additional fixes needed or if it can be merged.

**Should we write new unit tests for ticket [29274](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29274)**

Since James Bennett suggested that we randomly select lines from the new password list to ensure that it works, it seems that new tests aren't needed or wanted.

**Moving forward**

* We will continue to look for tickets so Kenneth, Shiyang, and Kelly can get commits in. 
* We will meet/talk as a group on Sunday
* If we cannot find any new issues, we will talk with Joanna.
* Finish [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-mZcuNnQHFCkEX4B5840NFgzw2LV5JVFcQYlHF9mz1c)
