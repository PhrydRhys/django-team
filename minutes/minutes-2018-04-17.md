Great news! Our [pull request](https://github.com/django/django/pull/9875) that was submitted [last friday](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/django-team/blob/master/minutes/minutes-2018-04-13.md) got merged.


Now that we got it merged, we have two avenues for additional contributions:
- Find a new ticket to work on
- Rohit also mentioned that, going off the feedback from the [Google Group Discussion Page](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/django-developers/oMWLVK5kTpI/7P4RBdBcCAAJ), we can submit more unit tests for the CommonPasswordValidator.

In addition to those two options, we have decided that, because we modified the common password list, it would be irresponsible of u to not update the the [password documentation page](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/auth/passwords/) with regards to the number common passwords from 1000 to 2000 and the name from "Mark Burnett" to "Royce Williams" for the new list.


As of typing this sentence, Shiyang is currently committing the changes to the documentation and submitting a PR.


We are currently looking at these new tickets:
- [29329](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29329)
- [29332](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29332)
- [29281](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29281)
- [27946](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/27946)
- [29249](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29249)
  - documentation
  - look at the changes in doc in the PR, add it
  - looks promising
- [27946](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/27946)
```diff
-todo: update tickets.md
```

While looking at new tickets, I realized that, while he have documented most (if not all) of the tickets we've looked at, we did not have an organized list of them, so I just created __**tickets.md**__ to have a semi-oragnized list.


When we tried to synch our branch with django's current branch version, we got a merge conflict with binary of the commonpasswords.txt, which we think it's a pseudo merge conflict, because I think our local version is out of synch with the django's repo. Aside from that, we're not exactly sure why there should be a conflict, because we never modified that file's binary.

#### Update:
- Kelly nuked her personal clone
- it worked!

### Goals to achieve by/during tomorrow's meeting (4/18):
- ~~fix merge conflict of our branch~~
- find a new ticket
- write new unit tests
- submit PR for documentation
- work on slides:
  - may 1st (tentative)
  - 20 mins
  - entire journey
  - looking at alt projects
  - ticket triaging process zzz
  - people beating us to the chase of getting tickets
  - talk about the issue and a small bit of approach to fix it
  - facing issues of what pw file to edit, how to edit it
  - ex. mention the google group maybe?
