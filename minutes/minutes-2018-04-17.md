Great news! Our [pull request](https://github.com/django/django/pull/9875) that was submitted [last friday](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/django-team/blob/master/minutes/minutes-2018-04-13.md) got merged.


Now that we got it merged, we have two avenues for additional contributions:
- Find a new ticket to work on
- Rohit also mentioned that, going off the feedback from the [Google Group Discussion Page](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/django-developers/oMWLVK5kTpI/7P4RBdBcCAAJ), we can submit more unit tests for the CommonPasswordValidator.

In addition to those two options, we have decided that, because we modified the common password list, it would be irresponsible of u to not update the the [password documentation page](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/auth/passwords/) with regards to the number common passwords from 1000 to 2000 and the name from "Mark Burnett" to "Royce Williams" for the new list.


As of typing this sentence, Shiyang is currently committing the changes to the documentation and submitting a PR.


We are currently looking at these new tickets:
